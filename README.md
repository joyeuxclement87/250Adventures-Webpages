## **Story and Inspiration**

250Adventure was inspired by a personal love for exploring Rwanda's rich culture and diverse landscapes. I wanted to create a platform that not only highlights the countryâ€™s most popular destinations but also makes it easier for tourists to connect with local guides and book their entire trip in one place.

## **Technical Challenges**
One of the biggest technical challenges was implementing the live chat functionality between users and tour guides. After considering several real-time communication protocols, I decided to use WebSocket for its efficiency in handling real-time interactions. While this was my first time working with WebSocket, I eventually built a scalable solution that allowed for seamless, real-time communication.
